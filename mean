Algorithm

1. Start the program by loading HL register pair with address of memory location.
2. Move the data to a B register.
3. Get the second data and load into Accumulator.
4. Compare the two numbers to check for carry.
5. Subtract the two numbers.
6. Increment the value of carry .
7. Check whether repeated subtraction is over and store the value of product and carry in memory location.
8. Terminate the program

Program

LXI H, 5000

MOV B, M ;Get the dividend in B - reg.

MVI C, 00 ;Clear C - reg for quotient

INX H ;Increment HL pair of registers

MOV A, M ;Get the divisor in A - reg

NEXT: CMP B ;Compare A - reg with register B.

JC LOOP ;Jump on carry to LOOP

SUB B ;Subtract A - reg from B - reg.

INR C ;Increment content of register C.

JMP NEXT ;Jump to NEXT

LOOP: STA 5002 ;Store the remainder in Memory

MOV A, C ;Move Content of C - Reg to A - Reg

STA 5003 ;Store the quotient in memory

HLT ;Terminate the program
